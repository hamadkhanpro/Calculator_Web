Calculator Web (When i was studying bscs (bachelor of science in computer science) and was in my 4th semester, there was a 4th semester project that i completed and thsi was the subject of web design & development and i used HTML, CSS, JavaScript languages coding in that project).

Objective:
The objective of the Calculator Web project is to design and develop a user-friendly, responsive web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) efficiently and accurately. The calculator should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless experience for users who need quick and reliable mathematical calculations online.

Project Scope:
1). Design and implementation of a web-based calculator interface.
2). Support for core arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
3). Implementation of decimal and clear (AC) functionality.
4). Responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices.
5). Basic error handling (e.g., division by zero).
6). Testing and debugging for usability and accuracy.

Calculator Key Points:
1). Simple and intuitive user interface.
2). Core arithmetic operations: +, –, ×, ÷.
3). Decimal support for precise calculations.
4). Clear (AC) and delete (DEL) buttons for input management.
5). Responsive design for all devices.
6). Error handling for invalid operations.
7). No data storage or user tracking.

Your Sincerely: We would happy to discuss this proposal further and answer any question you may have.
Thank you for considering our proposal and we look forward to the opportunity to collaborate on this exciting project.
